# Urban Movement - Traffic Management System
Simulations: https://youtu.be/8SiZdfqYlUI

Real time Unity3D simulation to represent traffic management in an intersection from randomly spawned cars.
* Implemented using Mesa (Python agent-based modeling framework) to represent car and traffic light intelligent agents that communicate together to take decisions.
* Unity requests a server running the model, the position of every car and state of traffic lights to visualize traffic flow.
* Reduced waiting time for cars at a traffic light by 7.7% compared to an intersection with fixed times for each traffic light.
